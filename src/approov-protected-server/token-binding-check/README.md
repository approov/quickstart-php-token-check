# Approov Token Binding Integration Example

This Approov integration example is from where the code example for the [Approov token binding check quickstart](/docs/APPROOV_TOKEN_BINDING_QUICKSTART.md) is extracted, and you can use it as a playground to better understand how simple and easy it is to implement [Approov](https://approov.io) in a PHP API server.

## Why?

To lock down your API server to your mobile app. Please read the brief summary in the [README](/README.md#why) at the root of this repo or visit our [website](https://approov.io/product.html) for more details.

[TOC](#toc---table-of-contents)


## How it works?

The PHP server is very simple and is defined in the file [src/approov-protected-server/token-check/hello-server-protected.php](src/approov-protected-server/token-check/hello-server-protected.php). Take a look at the verifyApproovToken() and verifyApproovTokenBinding functions to see the simple code for the checks.

For more background on Approov, see the overview in the [README](/README.md#how-it-works) at the root of this repo.

## Try the Approov Integration Example

First, you need to set the dummy secret in the `src/approov-protected-server/token-check/.env` file as explained [here](/README.md#the-dummy-secret).

Second, you need to install the dependencies. From the `src/approov-protected-server/token-check` folder execute:

```text
composer install
```

Now, you can run this example from the `src/approov-protected-server/token-check` folder with:

```text
php -S localhost:8002 hello-server-protected.php
```

Finally, you can test that the Approov integration example works as expected with this [Postman collection](/README.md#testing-with-postman) or with some cURL requests [examples](/README.md#testing-with-curl).
